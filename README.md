# Pokedex-with-PokeAPI
!NB! work in progress

I have used PokeAPI(https://pokeapi.co/) to create a Pokdex MVC with Flask. 

## Flders/Files

- **datagathering**
  - These programs calls the api, manipulates the data I want and stores them in a sqlite database.
  "data" is a folder with json-data on thep pokemons before its inserted to the database.
  
- **pokedex_MVC**
  - **Models**: Every model have correlated controller.
  - **Controllers**: Every controller have correlated model.
  - **Templates**: Views, html documents
  - **Static**: css and fonts
  - **weakness_calculator**: a program that calculates damage taken from all pokemon types.
